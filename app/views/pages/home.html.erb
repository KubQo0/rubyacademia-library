<h1 class="mb-4 text-xl font-semibold">Hi</h1>
<p>This is Challenge 1.</p>
<p>It's part of my journey through Ruby Academia.</p>
<p>For this project, I chose to build an app that serves as a library so you can keep track of your books.</p>
<div class="flex justify-end mt-4">
  <%= link_to "Library -->" , books_url, class: "border-blue-700 border-r-1 text-center text-blue-500 px-1 py-1 rounded-md" %>
</div>
